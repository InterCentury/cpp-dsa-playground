# 🚀 CPP-DSA-Playground

### Data Structures & Algorithms playground built with pure C++

Welcome to my personal **C++ DSA lab** 👨‍💻
This repository is where I **learn, implement, break, rebuild, and master** core data structures and algorithms from scratch.

No copy-paste.
No magic libraries.
Just raw logic + practice + experiments.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Understand DSA deeply (not just use STL)
* Implement everything from scratch
* Practice clean code & commit discipline
* Track learning progress using GitHub
* Prepare for interviews & competitive programming
* Build strong problem-solving skills

## 🧠 Implementations (Planned & Ongoing)

### 📦 Basic Structures

* [x] Dynamic Array (Vector)
* [x] Stack (Array + Linked List)
* [x] Queue
* [ ] Deque
* [ ] Hash Table

### 🌲 Trees

* [ ] Binary Tree
* [ ] BST
* [ ] AVL Tree
* [ ] Heap / Priority Queue
* [ ] Segment Tree

### 🔗 Graphs

* [ ] BFS / DFS
* [ ] Dijkstra
* [ ] Topological Sort
* [ ] Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

### ⚡ Algorithms

* [x] Bubble / Selection / Insertion
* [ ] Merge Sort
* [ ] Quick Sort
* [ ] Binary Search
* [ ] DP problems

(Updating continuously as I learn)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Language: **C++**
* Compiler: g++
* Build: CMake / CLI
* Style: Clean & modular code

---

## 📏 Rules I Follow

* Small, meaningful commits
* Clear commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
* Write code first, optimize later
* Focus on understanding, not memorizing
* Prefer implementing manually before using STL

---

## 📈 Why this repo exists?

I believe:

> The best way to learn programming is to build things yourself.

So this repo is my:

* playground 🎮
* notebook 📘
* experiment lab 🧪
* progress tracker 📊

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

(or build with CMake if needed)

This is not a perfect library —
it's a **learning journey**.

If you're learning DSA too, feel free to explore or learn along with me 😄
